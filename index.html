        <p>President (as if)</p>
        <p>Brennan, you wander the aisles of Costco. Enough said.
          Also the Astros are cheaters, again, enough said.
          Asking people to tell them about their favorite MarioKart 
          character is basically saying that you aren't really good and 
          you play once in a while but you want people to think you're 
          retro and vintage and indulge in a little bit of nostalgia 
          because you're so hip and cool. But also I love MarioKart and the best build is 
        Yoshi in a Biddy Buggy with Roller Wheels, and a parachute. </p>

        <p>External Relations Director because you can't make relations internally.
            Pickleball and thrifting? Tell me more about your unique and rare hobbies!

            I have no notes.

        <p>Administrative Director</p>
        <p>Saying you love going to unique coffee shops is like saying 
            you love trying unique things like playing pickleball (Looking at you Isabelle)

        <h3>Arjun</h3>
        <p>Internal Controls Director</p>
        <p>As a non-minor minoring in Philosopy (lol get it), 
          Do you ever quote Nietzche in stock pitches. I feel like comparing
            a stock with an ubermensch to advocate for a short position would
            be pretty convincing. The stock holds a life on its own, creating
            a conscious and then rebels against market forces to spite investors.

        <h3>Anita</h3>
        <p>Financial Director</p>
        <p>Hot take, Pitch-Perfect 1 had the best riff-off: Pitch-Perfect 2 
            inviting the Packers automatically invalidates the whole movie. Pitch-Perfect 3
            had instruments which makes the groups as virtuous as Brennan's Astros.
            Every viewer of Pitch-Perfect 1, on the other hand, got the best bang 
            for their buck. No props, no fancy stages, or military guests, Cynthia 
            colloquially killed it, Donald was incredibly underrated, and Jesse lowkey has rizz.

        <p>Academic Director</p>
        <p>Keep waiting on the Rockets, man. Also, they were never good. 
            You and Brennan are why people don't respect Houston sports. Give 
            it up and join the dark-side: the Memphis mfing Grizzlies.

        <p>Communications Director</p>
        <p>I'm not gonna lie, all you DECA officers were overshadowed by O'Brian.
            Too much charisma in that guy. If you know, you know.
